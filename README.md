# Internship Experience

Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE), DRDO 
Developed a deep learning model to predict car evaluations (unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good) based on features such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety rating. The Car Evaluation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used, and preprocessing steps included encoding categorical variables, splitting the data into training and test sets, and standardizing the features. A neural network architecture was built using TensorFlow and Keras, consisting of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer with softmax activation for classification. After training for 50 epochs, the model achieved an accuracy of around 95%, demonstrating effective learning and good generalization without overfitting.
